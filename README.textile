h1. LegendViewer: A Legend and Manager component for use with the "ESRI Flex API":http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/flex/index.html.

This is a tool that I needed for my day to workflow.
It is an update to the LegendManager tool that is part of my FlexMapTools.
Once I have worked on this tool a little more, I will replace that component.
This tool utilizes the new Legend REST endpoint that was added in Service Pack 1 to ESRI ArcGIS Server.

This tool also makes extensive use of "AS3Signals":https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals for communication between its various components.
You will need to download AS3Signals into your project to use this component.

h3. Disclaimer
Because ESRI has a download page for their Flex API where they ask that you register, I will not be providing the ESRI Flex API swc file.
Please visit the "ESRI Flex API dowload page":http://resources.arcgis.com/content/arcgis-flex-api-how-to-download

I am not employed or affiliated with ESRI beyond being a user of their products.

Enjoy.
